# Tic-Tac-Toe Flavors

This is my take on implementing Tic-Tac-Toe using various technologies including:

* jQuery
* Angular 1
* Angular 2
* ReactJS

Each solution shares a Tic-Tac-Toe model class that implements the logic for playing Tic-Tac-Toe. Therefore I am comparing how each technology presents and interacts with this model.

## Wish List

* ReactJS with Redux
* An AI engine for single player vs. Computer
